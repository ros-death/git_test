This is Git telling you that there are no unrecorded, uncommitted changes present in this directory. Note that Git refers to versioned_dir as the “working directory”. This is an important piece of terminology. The “working directory” is the term we use to refer to a directory that is being version controlled.

A clean working directory is one for which all changes are committed.
A dirty directory is one for which changes have not been committed

Exercise

Create a new file called something.md in versioned_dir. Type and add some text into this file, e.g. copy and paste in the text from this web page.
