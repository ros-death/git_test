This is Git telling you that there are no unrecorded, uncommitted changes present in this directory. Note that Git refers to versioned_dir as the “working directory”. This is an important piece of terminology. The “working directory” is the term we use to refer to a directory that is being version controlled.

A “clean” working directory is one for which all changes have been committed, while a “dirty” working directory is one that contains changes that have not yet been committed (i.e. recorded/saved).


Exercise

Create a new file called something.md in versioned_dir. Type and add some text into this file, e.g. copy and paste in the text from this web page.
